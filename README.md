# windowsProcessLauncher
C# CMDEXE application that makes Console block, so that other scripts can call the executable file and open/close applications on windows. This solves the problem of windows opening apps such as chrome in some random processor and instead makes it possible to shut down chrome after opening it (if user-data-dir is used)

I've also made one in Go, contact me if details needed
